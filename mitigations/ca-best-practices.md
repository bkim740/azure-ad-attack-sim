# Conditional Access Best Practices

- Avoid broad **exclusions** (e.g., `All users` except `Admins`).
- Prefer **groups** targeting (`Admins`, `Executives`, `Employees`).
- Use **Named locations** for corporate networks (lab IP) to reduce friction.
- Turn on **Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)** where supported.
- Periodically review **Report-only** results before enforcing.
